==============

Lockscreen App to turn Wi-Fi On or Off 
Pre-Alpha Release

This is an eclipse project (enabled with ADT). It is primarily intended to Android 4.2 + platforms. 
It solves a very small bug in android, the inability to control Wi-Fi when screen is locked. You may ask why is it necessary?

It is absolutely essential combined with a way to toggle data connectivity at lock screen. Because, once you drain out all attempts 
for patterns at lockscreen (maybe a friend of yours might do this) or all attempts to provide a pin, then android asks 
to unlock via gmail account (or some other account) point being you will have to be connected to internet(yes!) to do this.. 
Due to hard luck,if you have wifi and data turned off at that point, no one can save your data.
Had to hard-reset my phone twice because of this bug.

And so I made this. Will definitely improve on other features and ability to toggle data as well at key gaurd screen
just in case
