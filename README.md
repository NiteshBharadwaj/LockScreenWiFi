LockScreenWiFi
==============

A pre-alpha release of a Lockscreen App(Widget) to turn Wi-Fi On or Off 

This is an eclipse project (enabled with ADT). It is primarily intended to work on Android 4.2 + platforms. 
It solves a very small bug in android, the inability to control Wi-Fi when screen is locked. You may ask why is it necessary?

It is absolutely essential, combined with a way to toggle data connectivity, at lock screen. Because, once you drain out all attempts 
to unlock using patterns at lockscreen or all attempts to provide a pin (maybe a friend of yours might do this), then android asks 
to unlock via gmail account (or some other account), point being you will have to be connected to internet(yes!) to do this.. 
Due to hard luck,if you have wifi and data both turned off at that point, no one can save your data from being destroyed.

Had to hard-reset my phone twice because of this bug!

And so, I made this. Will definitely improve on other features and ability to toggle data as well at key gaurd screen
just in case. Feel free to contribute as this might be very helpful to many users in case you are bored-to-death guy like me
